Magnum/Corrade Hot Reload
=========================

*Proof of concept implementation of hot reloading using corrade.*

Inspired by
[a blog post on ourmachinery.com](http://ourmachinery.com/post/dll-hot-reloading-in-theory-and-practice/),
 I was motivated to finally implement hot reloading. As I use
[magnum](https://magnum.graphics) and [corrade](https://github.com/mosra/corrade/)
 for my lower-level projects, it is based on these (i.e. Corrade only, as it has
everything I need) and I hope the community will profit from that in some way.

Currently only Windows is supported

# Building

The project relies on [CMake](https://cmake.org/). You can use [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start)
or [build Corrade yourself](http://doc.magnum.graphics/corrade/building-corrade.html).
After that, building this project should be a matter of:

~~~
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target install
~~~

Potentially with additional parameters like `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` or
`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` depending on your specific setup.

# Running

After building, running on Windows is as simple as:

~~~
cd build/src
HotReloadApplication.exe
cd ..
# Make change in TestModule.cpp
cmake --build . --target TestModule
# Magic!
~~~

# Licence
